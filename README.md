i want to know who made this game, everything is a texture, i have never seen so many files for so many useless purposes. anyway good luck browsing that. [aep is heavily recommended if you want to actually find stuff](https://assets.escartem.eu.org)

Do not clone the repo, download if you really need it but no clone unless you want a 64gb folder ðŸ’€

### Folders & cool stuff
Chapter -> mainly the slideshow images
BP -> Battle pass
Other & Value -> some unsorted items, may be interesting
Event -> all actual events or storyline stuff
Other / all sactx files -> Atlases for ui
Zero & Main -> open world it seems
Cup/Cup.png -> it's just funny
Gacha -> self explanatory i think

lastly for some reason a few files refused to make it in the repo, you can download them [here](https://ua4e.escartem.eu.org/nap/patch/2024-07-16.zip) (they're just some air conditioner stuff or smth)
